    // !!!!!! When we are using an event listener for a button or form submission 
    //or any kind of event listener we do not need to worry about the onload
    // problem because the event (like a button click ) can only happen after the 
    // Document is loaded anyway
    //DOMContentLoaded is the event 

    //in some ways this is behaving like an event listener because
    // when the browser has finished processing all of the CSS and HTML
    // it will throw an event that saying the browser is done processing all the  HTML and CSS
